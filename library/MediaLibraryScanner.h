 * @class MediaLibraryScanner
 * @brief Background worker for recursive directory scanning and metadata
 * extraction.
 *
 * Runs in its own thread (via BLooper and a separate worker thread).
 * Scans a directory tree, identifies audio files, extracts metadata using
 * TagLib, and sends batches of `MediaItem`s to the `MediaLibraryCache` for storage.
 *
 * Supports incremental scanning by checking file modification times against
 * a provided cache map.
