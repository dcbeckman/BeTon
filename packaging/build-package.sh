# MUST RUN ON HAIKU -- it needs `package`, and it links against the Haiku
# libraries the resulting package will declare requirements on.
#
# Usage:  packaging/build-package.sh [<source-dir>]
#
# <source-dir> defaults to the repository root, i.e. building the working tree.
# Pass an unpacked release tarball instead to build exactly what the HaikuPorts
# recipe would build:
#     packaging/build-package.sh /boot/home/build/Beton-1.3.0

#
# VERSION_BASE is the upstream version; VERSION appends OUR package revision.
# Bump the revision (not the base) when the packaging changes but the source
# does not -- a rebuilt package with identical contents and the same version
# is indistinguishable to pkgman, so clients never pick it up.
VERSION_BASE="1.3.1"
# Revision resets to 1 on an upstream version bump -- it counts OUR packaging
# iterations of a given upstream version, not builds overall.
#
# History worth keeping: 1.3.0-1 was linked against ffmpeg6, purely because
# ffmpeg6_devel happened to be the devel package installed on the build box.
# Upstream has declared ffmpeg8 since the 1.2.0 recipe and has never used
# ffmpeg6. 1.3.0-2 corrected that; see the clean-build note below for why the
# correction needed a from-scratch rebuild to take effect.

# silent, shippable defect -- the app just runs in English.
# ⚠️ ALWAYS FROM CLEAN. Beton's Makefile links ffmpeg by bare name (avcodec,
# avformat, avutil, swresample) and resolves whatever
# /boot/system/develop/lib/libavcodec.so points at -- a symlink owned by
# whichever single ffmpeg*_devel is installed (they conflict; only one can be).
# Swapping ffmpeg6_devel for ffmpeg8_devel therefore changes what a build links
# against while touching NO source file, so make would keep every stale .o and
# emit a binary linked half against each. Nothing in the build would complain.
# That is how 1.3.0-1 shipped ffmpeg6-linked in the first place.
