# Assemble the Indispensable Labs apps repository from the .hpkg files in
# packaging/out/ PLUS whatever is already published, into packaging/out-repo/.
#
# MUST RUN ON HAIKU -- it needs `package_repo`.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS SCRIPT DOWNLOADS THE LIVE REPOSITORY FIRST
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `package_repo create` does not amend an index, it writes a new one. The index
# it writes lists exactly the packages handed to it -- so a repository holding
# two apps, rebuilt from one app's out/ directory, comes back holding one app.
# The other app's .hpkg stays in the bucket (publish-repo.sh copies, it does
# not sync) but nothing references it, so `pkgman install` can no longer see
# it. Nothing errors. The publish verification passes. The app just vanishes.
#
# This repository crossed that threshold on 2026-08-29, when MidiMonitor became
# the second app alongside Beton. Both apps' copies of this script therefore
# pull the published index down, enumerate it with `package_repo list -f`, and
# re-index every package they find alongside the locally built ones.
#
# The consequence worth understanding: publishing ANY app republishes ALL of
# them, byte-for-byte, from the copies in the bucket. That is why the pulled
# packages are checksum-verified against the index that named them -- we are
# putting our name on those bytes again.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NO SIGNING EXISTS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Haiku has no package signing. The only integrity is a checksum chain that
# never leaves the origin: repo.sha256 -> repo -> per-package checksum -> .hpkg.
# That detects a corrupted download; it cannot detect a substituted one,
# because whoever can replace a .hpkg can replace the index that names its
# checksum. So whoever can write to the bucket controls what these users run.
#
# This repository carries ordinary userland apps rather than kernel drivers, so
# the blast radius is smaller than Media-OS's -- but it is not zero, and it is
# the reason SHA256SUMS is emitted below for publication somewhere structurally
# independent of the bucket (the git repo / a GitHub release). That is the only
# out-of-band check a suspicious user can make.

# stores the base URL the user typed into their local repo config and keeps it.
# Moving hosts later means every existing user must drop-repo and add-repo.
#
# NO HAIKU RELEASE IN THIS PATH -- compatibility is per package, via
# `requires { haiku >= ... }`. Must stay in step with URL_PATH in
# publish-repo.sh; that script fails the publish if the two ever drift.
