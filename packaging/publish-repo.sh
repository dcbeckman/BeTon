# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE UPLOAD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# packages -> repo.info -> repo -> repo.sha256 LAST. repo.sha256 is what tells
# a client its cached index is stale, so it must not appear until everything it
# points at is already fetchable. Do NOT replace this with `rclone sync`.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE BUCKET NAME IS NOT PART OF THE URL
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# rclone's S3 backend reads the FIRST path component after the colon as the
# BUCKET, not as a key prefix: `remote:a/b/c` means bucket `a`, key `b/c`.
# The bucket is `hpkg`, the custom domain is bound to that bucket, and
# `apps/...` is a key prefix inside it -- exactly as `media-os/...` is for the
# Media-OS repository. The two repositories share the bucket, the domain and
# the R2 token, and share nothing else.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS PUBLISHES THE WHOLE REPOSITORY, NOT JUST BETON
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The apps repository holds more than one app (Beton and MidiMonitor as of
# 2026-08-29) and there is one shared index. build-repo.sh assembles that index
# from packaging/out/ plus everything already published, so out-repo/ is the
# complete repository and this script replaces the live one with it. Do not run
# this against an out-repo/ built with --no-pull unless dropping the other apps
# is what you actually mean to do. The `--prune` step below is what makes such
# a mistake irreversible.

# and the bucket-scoped token cannot do that; the error names CreateBucket, not
